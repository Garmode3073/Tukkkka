# TUKKKKA - A NUMBER GUESSING GAME

___



Our project basically is a game to entertain the user. It uses the simplest interaction from user. The game has all the instructions available within. 

## SOLUTION DESIGN

___



We used tkinter toolkit for GUI. We also used "random" module of python. All the widgets used are simplified for the ease of interaction between application and user.

**1. Home Screen**

This is the page the user will see when he opens the application or (runs tukkkka.py).

**2. New Game Screen**

When user selects "New Game" option, he/she will get the following screen where the user needs to select a level of hardness for the game to be played.

**3.  Game Play**

Here are a few stills from the game.

* Top left image is the first screen user sees when game starts. Question, remaining lives and a space for writing answer is provided
* Top right image is seen when the user guesses the correct number and wins the game.
* Bottom right image is seen when the user breaks the high score. the application asks for user's name.
* Bottom left image is seen when user answers incorrectly.

**4. High Score **

When user asks for high score, user gets the same screen as he/she gets when user clicks on new game. This screen has exact same three options i.e Easy, Medium, Hard. On clicking on any one of them the high score will be shown in the form of messagebox.

**5. Instructions**

Instruction screen is one of the simplest interactions between application and user. User needs to click on "Instruction" button read the instructions written and get back by clicking "Back" button.

 ## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

---

We have used python language, tkinter library mostly for the GUI of application. We have also used "random" module of python for randomly selecting any number between a certain range for guessing. We have used file handling for keeping track of current high score.

## HOW TO RUN LOCALLY

---

1. Go to the Project folder in your system

2. First do this setup

   * ```
     pip install tkinter
     ```

3. Run tukkkka.py
